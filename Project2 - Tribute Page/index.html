           <strong>1966</strong>
           <p class="text"> The life story of one of the best Czech athletes in history did not start very well. Jan Železný was born on June 16, 1966, in the seventh month of pregnancy weighing 2.3 kilograms, and the left foot unnaturally retracted because of the shortened tendons. In his childhood, he was miserable for a variety of injuries, often sick and difficult to cope with his elder brother Peter. Thanks to the sad detour, he learned to overcome the complex obstacles, which later led him to the world’s Javelin Throw throne </p>
